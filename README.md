# Caravan-Insurance - Data Analytics

- Analysed the caravan customer
dataset of an insurance company. 
- The data analytical task was to
predict whether a customer was interested in a caravan insurance policy from the data.
- In addition, I derived information about the profile of a typical caravan insurance buyer.
